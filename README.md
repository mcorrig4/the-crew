## Why I Built This

I played this game for a week with my family on vacation and we loved it. I wanted to create a digital version so that we can continue to play together. I am building this for fun and to test my ability to prompt LLM agents to build products. I am using: 

- **Planning/management:** ChatGPT (o3-pro)  
- **Coding assistant:** Claude Code  
- **Manual edits & IDE:** Cursor IDE (as little as possible!)
