# Milestone 0 – Tooling & Skeleton

## Goal
Stand up the empty project shell so that **`yarn dev`** shows the Vite splash page, **`yarn test`** passes (no tests yet), and the repo already contains every folder and placeholder doc needed for future work.

## Success Criteria
* Git repo initialised with first commit on branch `feat/m00-bootstrap`.
* Yarn 3 (berry) is the package‑manager.
* Tailwind CSS and Storybook 8 run locally.
* ESLint, Prettier, Husky pre‑push hook and lint‑staged configured.
* Vitest executes (0 passing).
* Folder structure present (`src/game`, `src/ui`, `docs/…`, `commands/…`, etc.).
* Placeholder markdown files exist for all guideline & agent‑prompt docs listed in Milestone‑prep.
* CI workflow installs, lints and tests on every PR.
* README root section explains install & start commands.

## Out of Scope
* No game code, UI components, or actual tests.
* No cloud resources or Supabase.
* No Storybook stories beyond the default example.
