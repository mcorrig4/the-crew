1. Follow `@docs/guidelines/STYLE_GUIDE.md` and `@docs/guidelines/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md`.
2. Components live in `src/ui/` and must have a Storybook story.
3. No game‑state mutations; consume props typed in `src/types/`.
4. Tests go in `src/ui/__tests__/` using `@testing-library/react`.

Output: git diff + new/updated `.stories.tsx` + test files.
