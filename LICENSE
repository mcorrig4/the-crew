MIT-ish

Go read the README.md

I do not own the IP to the game. All code can be considered MIT licensed, but none of the game logic can be used. Please make sure you own a physical copy of the game before reading, modifying, or running any code in this repo.

Go find the MIT license... basically do whatever you want with the code, but do not use the game logic without ethically respecting the original game developer.
